Writing a README File
A README file is a crucial document for your project, providing a concise overview of what the project is, how to install it, and how to use it. Here's an outline and explanation of the syntax and structure:

File Name and Format
File Name: README or README.md (the .md extension indicates Markdown format).
Format: Markdown is the most common for README files because of its simplicity and readability.
Structure
Start with a Title
Title: Center it using # for heading 1. Use the project name.
Example: # Project Name
Table of Contents
TOC: Helps users navigate your file. Use Markdown's ability to link to header titles.
Example:
## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)
- [Contribution Guidelines](#contribution-guidelines)
- [License](#license)
